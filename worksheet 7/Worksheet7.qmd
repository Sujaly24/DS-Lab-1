## Web scraping...

In this worksheet, we will continue scraping the web. First we load some packages

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

We will continue with our Movie database example, and extract more detailed information. Any given movie on top 100 movies to watch on Netflix right now, there is a website dedicated to that movie. For example, the movie `His House` has the following website:

![](HisHouse.png){width="654"}

Go to the URL: `https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/his_house` to see what the page looks like.

1.  Our goal in this worksheet is to extract the following information for all 100 movies:

    a.  Tomatometer score

    b.  Popcornmeter

    c.  Number of Tomatometer Reviews

    d.  Number of Popcornmeter ratings (if over 1000, save as just 1000)

    Create a dataset of the final information and save the dataset in an `Rdata` file using command below (where `data` is the name of your object)

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    save(data, file = "TomatoList.Rdata")
    ```

2.  For each movie, notice that there is a poster as well. I am interested in answering the question, does the poster have anything to do with the ratings of a movie. What can you do with the posters to address this question?
